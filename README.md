# personal-finance-tracker

This project involves creating an interactive, text-based Personal Finance Tracker App that helps users manage and analyze their spending habits. Users can import a CSV file containing transaction data, perform operations like viewing, adding, editing, and deleting transactions, and analyze spending patterns. The app also includes data visualization capabilities, displaying monthly spending trends and top spending categories.
