# ðŸ“ˆðŸ’² Personal Finance Tracker App

Objective: This project involves creating an interactive, text-based Personal Finance Tracker App that helps users manage and analyze their spending habits. Users can import a CSV file containing transaction data, perform operations like viewing, adding, editing, and deleting transactions, and analyze spending patterns. The app also includes data visualization capabilities, displaying monthly spending trends and top spending categories.

## ðŸ“‘ Description
In this project, I developed a program to track my finances, organized into four files. The first file contains the main menu, which allows users to choose different actions related to their finances. The second file includes functions for managing transactions, such as loading a CSV file of bank transactions, viewing all transactions, filtering by date range, and adding, editing, or deleting individual transactions. The third file focuses on spending analysis, offering functions to analyze spending by category, calculate the average monthly spending, and identify the top spending category. Finally, the fourth file provides data visualization, showcasing the monthly spending trend.
